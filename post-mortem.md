# Plant Partner Post-mortem

## Things we did well
* Project management, we had no significant merge conflicts and kept everything clean throughout the project.
* Communication, altough we were unable to work "closely" together we worked closely. We were able to work as a unit and give support where and when needed.
* We stuck to the plan. Although we hit some speedbumps we persisted and in the end accomplished our goal.

## Things we leaned / can improve on
* Overall understanding of how the front-end and back-end are connecting.
* Abstraction to create clean easily executable code.
* Understanding of online documentation to help us work through issues that arise.
